Description: Intel(R) Intelligent Storage Acceleration Library - tools
 Collection of low-level functions used in storage applications.
 Contains fast erasure codes that implement a general
 Reed-Solomon type encoding for blocks of data that helps protect against
 erasure of whole blocks. The general ISA-L library contains an expanded
 set of functions used for data protection, hashing, encryption, etc.
 .
 This package contains CLI tools.
